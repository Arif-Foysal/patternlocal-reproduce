# natgrad-explanations Pipeline — Operating Guide

## Project
This protocol translates the core insight—that a generative explanation formed from a local linear surrogate is mathematically equivalent to the Natural Gradient in the input space—into a rigorous, step-by-step experimental plan. By replacing PatternLocal's dependency on LIME with an exact analytical gradient and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) covariance, we aim to reduce the O(D^3) computational bottleneck to an O(K * D) operation, reducing inference time from 12.9 seconds to milliseconds while eliminating the need for superpixels.

## Architecture
- `src/natgrad_xai.py` — core library, uploaded to Kaggle as dataset `mdzero591/natgrad-explanations-core`
- `pipeline.py` — CLI for push/status/fetch/upload-src/upload-results
- `config.yaml` — username, datasets, phases, success criteria
- `templates/` — pristine notebook templates (checked in)
- `notebooks/` — working copies you edit (gitignored)
- `results/` — downloaded Kaggle outputs (gitignored)

## Environment
The Kaggle API token lives in `.env` (gitignored) and is loaded automatically by `pipeline.py`. Just activate the venv:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python pipeline.py push notebooks/<phase>.py    # token loads from .env
```
If `.env` is missing, create it with `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN=KGAT_...` from kaggle.com/settings.

## Running an experiment
1. `cp templates/<phase>.py notebooks/<phase>.py` (or `python pipeline.py generate <phase>`)
2. Edit `notebooks/<phase>.py` if needed (parameters, etc.)
3. `python pipeline.py push notebooks/<phase>.py`
4. `python pipeline.py wait <phase>` — single blocking call; prints one line per state change. Returns 0 on complete, non-zero on error/timeout.
5. `python pipeline.py fetch <phase>`
6. Read `results/<slug>/*.json` and grep `[RESULT]` lines to judge success. Use `python pipeline.py tail <phase>` for the last 40 log lines if you need to debug — never `cat` the full `.log`.

## Iteration protocol
When a notebook fails or success criteria aren't met:
- **Notebook bug** (syntax, shapes, logic) → edit `notebooks/<phase>.py`, re-push
- **Core math/lib bug** → edit `src/natgrad_xai.py`, run `python pipeline.py upload-src`, **wait ~5 min**, re-push the notebook
- **Parameter issue** → tweak the notebook's config section, re-push
- **After 5 retries on the same notebook** → stop and ask the human

## Between phases
When phase N's outputs feed phase N+1:
1. `python pipeline.py upload-results phaseN`
2. Add the new dataset slug to `config.yaml` under `kaggle.datasets` (the CLI prints the line to add)
3. In `config.yaml` under the next notebook, add the key to its `datasets:` list

## Output conventions (do not break)
- `core.format_result(key, value)` — emits a greppable `[RESULT]` line
- `core.save_results(dict, path)` — writes JSON to `/kaggle/working/`
- Plots saved as PNG to `/kaggle/working/`

## Token-cost discipline (read this — it's why the harness exists)
- **Only three signals matter for "did this work?"**: `results/<slug>/*.json`, `[RESULT]` lines (use `pipeline.py results <phase>` or `pipeline.py fetch`), and the kernel state from `pipeline.py wait`. Don't Read raw `.log` files into context; use `pipeline.py tail <phase>` if you need recent log lines.
- **Use `wait`, not a polling loop.** One `python pipeline.py wait <phase>` is dramatically cheaper in context tokens than running `status` 6× in a row.
- **Keep `pipeline.py`, `src/natgrad_xai.py`, `templates/` stable across iterations.** They are the cacheable prompt prefix; edit them only for durable changes. Iterate on `notebooks/<phase>.py`.
- **Don't print large arrays.** Truncate to a few items + length. `_pretty_print` already enforces this for fetched JSON.

## When to stop and ask
- Phase boundary transitions (gate decisions)
- 5 retries exhausted
- Borderline / ambiguous results
- Anything that needs scientific judgement
- Before destructive actions (deleting kernels, force-pushing, etc.)

## Gotchas
- **Kaggle dataset propagation lag**: new dataset versions take ~5 minutes to mount in kernels. After `upload-src` or `upload-results`, wait before re-pushing.
- **`datasets create` silently no-ops** on existing datasets. The CLI handles this by trying `datasets version` first; don't bypass that pattern.
- **Kaggle datasets**: when uploading datasets with subdirectories to Kaggle, the CLI requires `--dir-mode zip` or `--dir-mode tar`. Without it, directories are skipped. Pipeline.py has been fixed to include `--dir-mode zip`.
- **Mount paths drift**: always `os.walk` to find `natgrad_xai.py` rather than hardcoding `/kaggle/input/<slug>/`.
- **GPU quota** is ~30h/week on free Kaggle. Set `gpu: false` in `config.yaml` for any notebook that doesn't need it.
- **Auth**: `pipeline.py` loads `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN` from `.env` automatically. If commands fail with 401/403, verify `.env` exists at repo root and contains a valid `KGAT_*` token.
